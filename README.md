## 📘 Overview  

**MoonHabitableZone** is a Python-based research project that explores the potential existence of **moons around exoplanets** using data-driven analysis and a newly proposed **Moon Stability Zone (MSZ)** formula.  
It combines **astrophysics**, **data science**, and **machine learning** to identify exoplanets that may host stable moons, expanding our understanding of planetary system dynamics beyond the Solar System.  

This repository contains the implementation for the paper:  
> **“Discovery of Potential Moons Around Exoplanets: Data Analysis Using Python and Development of a Moon Stability Zone Formula”**  
> — *Swayam Singh Sikarwar, Ankit Sharma, Jagriti Singh Thakur*

## 🧠 Scientific Motivation  

Since the discovery of the first exoplanet in 1992, thousands of such planets have been found — yet **exomoons** remain one of astronomy’s greatest mysteries. Moons play critical roles in planetary stability, climate regulation, and habitability. Detecting and characterizing exomoons can provide valuable insights into the **formation and evolution** of planetary systems.  

The **Moon Stability Zone (MSZ)** defines the orbital region where a moon can remain stable — bounded by:  
- **Stable Radius** → the planet’s gravitational influence limit (outer bound)  
- **Roche Limit** → the inner limit where tidal forces disrupt moon orbits  

If  
\[
\text{Moon Diameter} < \text{MSZ}
\]  
then the moon can exist in a **stable orbit**.

## 🪐 Key Features  

- 📊 **Data Analysis** of NASA Exoplanet Archive datasets  
- 🧮 Calculates **Hill Radius**, **Roche Limit**, and **Moon Stability Zone**  
- 🤖 Integrates **Machine Learning (Decision Tree Classifier)** to detect potential moons  
- 📈 Produces detailed visualizations (Matplotlib + Seaborn)  
- 🔭 Validated against known Solar System moons (Earth–Moon, Jupiter–Europa, Saturn–Titan)

Clone the repository and install required packages:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swayamsikarwar/MoonHabitableZone.git
cd MoonHabitableZone
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Example `requirements.txt`:

```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the analysis directly from the command line:

```bash
python scripts/moon_stability_zone.py
```

Or explore the step-by-step workflow interactively:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/MoonHabitableZone.ipynb
```

Outputs include:

* Calculated Hill Radius and Roche Limit for each exoplanet
* Stability Zone visualization
* Machine learning classification results

---

## 🧩 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**

   * Source: NASA Exoplanet Archive
   * Extracted features: planetary mass, radius, orbital period, host star mass & temperature

2. **Data Cleaning & Filtering**

   * Removed nulls, duplicates, and systems sharing the same host star
   * Focused on exoplanets with Transit Time Variation (TTV > 0)

3. **Computation of Orbital Parameters**

   * Hill Radius
   * Roche Limit
   * Moon Stability Zone (MSZ = Stable Radius − Roche Limit)

4. **Machine Learning Integration**

   * Decision Tree Classifier used for binary classification (`has_moon` vs `no_moon`)
   * Evaluated using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1/F₂** scores

5. **Validation**

   * Tested with real Solar System data (Earth, Jupiter, Saturn)
   * Verified predicted stability zones align with known moon orbits
